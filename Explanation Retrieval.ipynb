    "One of the main function of an explanatory argument is to fit the explanandum (i.e., the event to be explained) into a broader pattern that maximises unification, showing that a set of apparently unrelated phenomena are part of a common regularity (Kitcher, 1981; Kitcher, 1989). From a linguistic point of view, the process of unification tends to generate sentence-level explanatory patterns that can be reused and instantiated for deriving and explaining many phenomena. In natural language, unification generally emerges as a process of abstraction from the explanandum through the implicit search of common high-level features and similarities between different phenomena.\n",
