(* Explanation 1: Usually, people learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. People x ∧ HowToReadAndWrite y ∧ Learn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ InSchool e"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Trait x ⟷ SynonymousWith x y ∧ Characteristic y"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. InheritedCharacteristics x ⟶ OppositeOf x y ∧ LearnedCharacteristics y ∧ AcquiredCharacteristics z"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∀e1 e2. Inheriting e1 ⟷ (Copied e2 ∧ InheritedCharacteristic e2) ∨ (Passed e2 ∧ FromParent e2 ∧ ToOffspring e2 ∧ ByGenetics e2 ∧ DNA e2)"

(* Explanation 5: Learned characteristics are a type of trait, and being able to read is a specific learned characteristic that qualifies as a trait. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. LearnedCharacteristics x ⟶ TypeOf x y ∧ Trait y ∧ (BeingAbleToRead z ⟶ SpecificLearnedCharacteristic z ∧ QualifiesAs z y)"

(* Explanation 6: Being able to read is a learned characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_6: "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ LearnedCharacteristic x"

(* Explanation 7: All learned characteristics, including being able to read, are traits. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_7: "∀x y. LearnedCharacteristics x ⟶ Trait y ∧ Including x y ∧ BeingAbleToRead y"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BeingAbleToRead x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that being able to read is true for some entity x. *)
  from asm have "BeingAbleToRead x" by simp
  (* From the logical relation Implies(K, E), we can infer that being able to read implies learned characteristics. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristics x" sledgehammer
  (* From the logical relation Implies(E, M), we can infer that learned characteristics are a type of trait. *)
  then have "TypeOf x y ∧ Trait y" <ATP>
  (* From the logical relation Implies(K, B), we can infer that being able to read implies trait. *)
  then have "Trait x" <ATP>
  (* From the logical relation Implies(K, N), we can infer that being able to read implies all learned characteristics. *)
  then have "AllLearnedCharacteristics x" <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can conclude that being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
