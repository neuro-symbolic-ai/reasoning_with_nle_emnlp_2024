(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Has x y ∧ ComparedTo y z)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ Means x y ∧ Daylight z ∧ There z)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Means x y)"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ Season y"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere, which means it has more hours of sunlight than other seasons. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∀x y z w v u t. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ LongestHours z ∧ In z w ∧ Means v u ∧ Has v w ∧ MoreHours w)"

(* Explanation 6: The amount of sunlight during summer corresponds to having more hours of sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_6: "∀x y z w. AmountOfSunlight x ⟶ (CorrespondsTo y ∧ Having z ∧ MoreHours w ∧ ComparedTo w t)"

(* Explanation 7: Longer daylight hours during summer directly imply that there is more sunlight available during this season. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_7: "∀x y z w t. LongerHours x ⟶ (DirectlyImply y ∧ MoreSunlight z ∧ Available z w ∧ During w t)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ When z ⟶ (MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight w ∧ In w z))"
