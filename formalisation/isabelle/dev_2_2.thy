(* Explanation 1: Usually, people learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. People x ∧ School z ⟶ (Learn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In x z ∧ HowToReadAndWrite y)"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Trait x ⟷ SynonymousWith x y ∧ Characteristic y"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. InheritedCharacteristics x ⟷ OppositeOf x y ∧ LearnedCharacteristics y ∧ AcquiredCharacteristics z"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∃e x y z. Inheriting e ⟷ (When e ∧ InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ Copied x) ∧ (PassedFromParentToOffspring e y z ∧ Genetics z ∧ DNA z)"

(* Explanation 5: Learned characteristics are a type of trait. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∃x y. LearnedCharacteristics x ⟶ TypeOf x y ∧ Trait y"

(* Explanation 6: Being able to read is a learned characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_6: "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ LearnedCharacteristic x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BeingAbleToRead x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∃x. Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that being able to read is a learned characteristic. *)
  from asm have "BeingAbleToRead x" by simp
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(J, E), which states that being able to read implies learned characteristics. *)
  (* Thus, we can infer that learned characteristics hold. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristic x" by (simp add: explanation_6)
  (* From Explanation 5, learned characteristics are a type of trait. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that being able to read is a trait. *)
  then have "Trait y" for y sledgehammer
  (* We can now conclude that being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
