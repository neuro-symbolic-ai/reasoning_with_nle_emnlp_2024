(* Explanation 1: little boy is a young child. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. LittleBoy x ⟶ YoungChild x"

theorem hypothesis:
  (* Premise 1: a couple playing with a little boy on the beach *)
  assumes asm: "Couple x ∧ LittleBoy y ∧ Playing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ OnBeach y"
  (* Hypothesis: a couple are playing with a young child outside. *)
  shows "∃x y z e. Couple x ∧ YoungChild y ∧ Playing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Outside y"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we can extract the known information about the couple, little boy, playing, agent, and patient. *)
  from asm have "Couple x ∧ LittleBoy y ∧ Playing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ OnBeach y" by fastforce
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), which states that a little boy is a young child. *)
  (* Since we have LittleBoy y, we can infer YoungChild y. *)
  then have "Couple x ∧ YoungChild y ∧ Playing e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ OnBeach y" by (simp add: explanation_1)
  (* We need to show that the child is outside. Since the premise states they are on the beach, we can infer that they are outside. *)
  then have "Outside y" sledgehammer
