(* Explanation 1: Being able to read is a learned characteristic that is acquired through education. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ (LearnedCharacteristic x ∧ AcquiredThroughEducation x)"

(* Explanation 2: All learned characteristics, including being able to read, are considered traits. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. LearnedCharacteristic x ⟶ Trait x"

(* Explanation 3: A learned characteristic is a specific type of trait that can be demonstrated through actions such as reading. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x. LearnedCharacteristic x ⟶ (SpecificType x ∧ Trait x ∧ DemonstratedThroughActions x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BeingAbleToRead x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∃y. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ (Example x ∧ LearnedCharacteristic x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x is able to read. *)
  from asm have "BeingAbleToRead x" by simp
  (* From Explanation 1, we can infer that being able to read is a learned characteristic. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(A, B), Implies(being able to read, learned characteristic). *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristic x" using explanation_1 by auto
  (* We can now conclude that being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
