(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Has x y)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ During z ∧ Daylight w ∧ Agent z w)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ Sunlight y"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ (Kind y ∧ Season z ∧ Of y z)"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z w v. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ NorthernHemisphere w ∧ With y z ∧ In z w)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z e. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ When e ∧ MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight w ∧ NorthernHemisphere v ∧ In w v ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Summer x holds. *)
  from asm have "Summer x" by blast
  (* From explanation 5, we can infer that Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  (* This implies that Summer is a kind of season and has the most sunlight. *)
  then have "Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ NorthernHemisphere v" by (simp add: explanation_5)
  (* We can also infer that there are more hours of sunlight during Summer. *)
  then have "MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight w" sledgehammer
  (* We can now construct the final statement with the necessary components. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
