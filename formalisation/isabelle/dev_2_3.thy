(* Explanation 1: Usually, people learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. People x ∧ School z ⟶ (Learn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In x z ∧ HowToReadAndWrite y)"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y. Trait x ⟷ (SynonymousWith x y ∧ Characteristic y)"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x y z. InheritedCharacteristics x ⟶ (OppositeOf x y ∧ LearnedCharacteristics y ∧ AcquiredCharacteristics z)"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∀e1 e2 x. Inheriting e1 ⟷ (When e1 e2 ∧ InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ Copied x ∧ Passed x ∧ FromParentToOffspring x ∧ ByGenetics x)"

(* Explanation 5: Learned characteristics are a type of trait, and being able to read is a specific learned characteristic that qualifies as a trait. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. LearnedCharacteristics x ⟶ (TypeOf x y ∧ Trait y ∧ (BeingAbleToRead z ⟶ (SpecificLearnedCharacteristic z ∧ QualifiesAs z y)))"

(* Explanation 6: Being able to read is a learned characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_6: "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ LearnedCharacteristic x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BeingAbleToRead x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ (Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BeingAbleToRead x holds. *)
  from asm have "BeingAbleToRead x" by simp
  (* From Explanation 6, we can infer that BeingAbleToRead x implies LearnedCharacteristic x. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristic x" by (simp add: explanation_6)
  (* From Explanation 5, we know that LearnedCharacteristics imply Trait. *)
  (* Since BeingAbleToRead is a learned characteristic, we can conclude that it qualifies as a trait. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristics x" sledgehammer
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that BeingAbleToRead x is an example of a learned trait. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
