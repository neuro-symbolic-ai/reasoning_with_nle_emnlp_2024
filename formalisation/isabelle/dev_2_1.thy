(* Explanation 1: Usually, people learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. People x ∧ School z ⟶ (Learn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In x z ∧ HowToReadAndWrite y)"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x. Trait x ⟶ (∃y. SynonymousWith x y ∧ Characteristic y)"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x. InheritedCharacteristics x ⟶ (∃y z. OppositeOf x y ∧ LearnedCharacteristics y ∧ AcquiredCharacteristics z)"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∃e x y z. Inheriting e ⟶ (When e ∧ InheritedCharacteristic x ∧ Copied x ∧ PassedFromParentToOffspring x y z ∧ Genetics z ∧ DNA z)"

(* Explanation 5: Learned characteristics are a type of trait. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∀x. LearnedCharacteristics x ⟶ (∃y. TypeOf x y ∧ Trait y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BeingAbleToRead x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that BeingAbleToRead x holds. *)
  from asm have "BeingAbleToRead x" by auto
  (* According to Explanation 1, people learn how to read and write in school, which implies that BeingAbleToRead is a learned characteristic. *)
  (* We can infer that BeingAbleToRead is a learned characteristic, which is a type of trait. *)
  then have "LearnedCharacteristics x" sledgehammer
  (* From Explanation 5, learned characteristics are a type of trait. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that BeingAbleToRead x is a learned trait. *)
  then have "Trait y ∧ LearnedTrait x" for y <ATP>
  (* Finally, we can conclude that BeingAbleToRead x is an example of a learned trait. *)
  then show "Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x" <ATP>
