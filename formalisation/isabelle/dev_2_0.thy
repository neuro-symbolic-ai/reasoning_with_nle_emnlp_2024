(* Explanation 1: Usually people learn how to read and write in school. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y z e. People x ∧ HowToReadAndWrite y ∧ School z ∧ Learn e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ In e z"

(* Explanation 2: Trait is synonymous with characteristic. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∃x y. Trait x ⟶ SynonymousWith x y ∧ Characteristic y"

(* Explanation 3: Inherited characteristics are the opposite of learned characteristics; acquired characteristics. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∃x y z. InheritedCharacteristics x ⟶ OppositeOf x y ∧ LearnedCharacteristics y ∧ AcquiredCharacteristics z"

(* Explanation 4: Inheriting is when an inherited characteristic is copied; is passed from parent to offspring by genetics; DNA. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∃e1 e2. Inheriting e1 ⟶ (When e1 ∧ InheritedCharacteristic e2 ∧ Copied e2 ∧ Passed e2 ∧ FromParentToOffspring e2 ∧ Genetics e2 ∧ DNA e2)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "BeingAbleToRead x"
  (* Hypothesis: Being able to read is an example of a learned trait. *)
  shows "∀x. BeingAbleToRead x ⟶ Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we have that x is able to read. *)
  from asm have "BeingAbleToRead x" by simp
  (* According to Explanation 1, people learn how to read and write in school, which implies that being able to read is a learned characteristic. *)
  (* Therefore, we can infer that BeingAbleToRead x is a learned trait. *)
  then have "Example x ∧ LearnedTrait x" sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
