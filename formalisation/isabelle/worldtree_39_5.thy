(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Most y ∧ ComparedTo y z ∧ Seasons z)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ During e ∧ Daylight z ∧ Is z)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ Sunlight y"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ (Seasons y)"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Seasons y ∧ LongestHours z ∧ DaylightHours z ∧ In z v)"

(* Explanation 6: The amount of sunlight during summer corresponds to having more hours of sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y z e. AmountOfSunlight x ∧ Summer y ⟶ (Corresponds e ∧ Having z ∧ MoreHours w ∧ Sunlight w ∧ ComparedTo w v ∧ Seasons v)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z e1 e2. Summer x ⟶ (Seasons y ∧ When e1 ∧ MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight w ∧ NorthernHemisphere v ∧ Hours z w ∧ In z v)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Summer x holds. *)
  from asm have "Summer x" by simp
  (* From explanation 4, we know that Summer is a kind of season. *)
  then have "Seasons y" using explanation_5 by blast
  (* From explanation 5, we know that Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  then have "LongestHours z ∧ DaylightHours z ∧ In z v" using assms explanation_5 by blast
  (* We can conclude that there are more hours of sunlight during summer. *)
  then have "MoreHours z" sledgehammer
  (* We also know that Daylight means Sunlight from explanation 3. *)
  then have "Sunlight w" <ATP>
  (* Now we can combine all the information to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
