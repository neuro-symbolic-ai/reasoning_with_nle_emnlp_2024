(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Most y ∧ ComparedTo y z ∧ OtherSeasons z)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ Daylight z ∧ During y z)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ Sunlight y"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∀x. Summer x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ NorthernHemisphere z)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight z ∧ NorthernHemisphere z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Summer x holds. *)
  from asm have "Summer x" by auto
  (* From explanation 5, we can infer that Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  (* There is a logical relation Implies(D, E), which states that if Summer is a kind of season, then it is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  (* We can use explanation 4 to establish that Summer is a kind of season. *)
  then have "Season x" by (simp add: explanation_4)
  (* Now we can conclude that Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  then have "LongestDaylightHours z ∧ NorthernHemisphere z" by (simp add: explanation_4)
  (* We also know from explanation 1 that Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
  (* This implies that there are more hours of sunlight during Summer. *)
  then have "MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight z" sledgehammer
  (* Combining all the information, we can conclude the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
