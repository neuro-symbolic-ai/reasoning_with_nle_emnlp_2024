(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z e. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Most y ∧ ComparedTo z ∧ OtherSeasons z)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y z e. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Means y ∧ Time y ∧ During e ∧ Daylight z ∧ Agent e z)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ Sunlight y"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Kind y ∧ Season z ∧ Of y z)"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e v. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ Longest z ∧ DaylightHours w ∧ In e w ∧ NorthernHemisphere v)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z e. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ When e ∧ MoreHours z ∧ Sunlight w ∧ In z w ∧ NorthernHemisphere w ∧ Agent e z ∧ Patient e y)"
