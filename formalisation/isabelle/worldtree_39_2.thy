(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y e. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Has e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ Most y ∧ ComparedTo y OtherSeasons)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ Means e x ∧ Patient e y ∧ During e ∧ Daylight z ∧ Is z)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x y e. Daylight x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Means e x ∧ Patient e y)"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ Season y"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_5: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ In z NorthernHemisphere)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ When e ∧ MoreHoursOfSunlight z ∧ In z NorthernHemisphere ∧ Hours z ∧ Sunlight z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Summer x holds. *)
  from asm have "Summer x" <ATP>
  (* From explanation 5, we can infer that Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  then have "Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ In z NorthernHemisphere" <ATP>
  (* Since Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons, we can conclude that there are more hours of sunlight. *)
  then have "MoreHoursOfSunlight z" <ATP>
  (* We also know that Daylight means sunlight, which can be inferred from explanation 3. *)
  then have "Sunlight z" <ATP>
  (* We can now combine all the information to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
