(* Explanation 1: Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y z. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Most y ∧ ComparedTo y z ∧ OtherSeasons z)"

(* Explanation 2: Daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y e. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ During e ∧ Daylight e ∧ Agent e y)"

(* Explanation 3: Daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ Sunlight y"

(* Explanation 4: Summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_4: "∀x. Summer x ⟶ Season x"

(* Explanation 5: Summer is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere, which means it has more hours of sunlight than other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_5: "∀x y z e1 e2. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ In z NorthernHemisphere ∧ MoreHoursOfSunlight e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ ComparedTo z y ∧ OtherSeasons y)"

(* Explanation 6: The amount of sunlight during summer corresponds to having more hours of sunlight compared to other seasons. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_6: "∀x y z e1 e2. AmountOfSunlight x ⟶ (Corresponds e1 ∧ Having e2 ∧ MoreHoursOfSunlight e1 ∧ ComparedTo z y ∧ OtherSeasons y)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀x y z e1 e2. Summer x ⟶ (Season y ∧ When e1 ∧ MoreHoursOfSunlight e2 ∧ Hours z ∧ Sunlight z ∧ In z NorthernHemisphere ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ Patient e1 z)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that Summer x holds. *)
  from asm have "Summer x" by blast
  (* From Explanation 5, we can infer that if Summer x, then it is the season with the longest daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  then have "Season y ∧ LongestDaylightHours z ∧ In z NorthernHemisphere ∧ MoreHoursOfSunlight e1 ∧ Agent e1 y ∧ ComparedTo z y ∧ OtherSeasons y" 
    by (simp add: explanation_5)
  (* We can conclude that Summer x implies that there are more hours of sunlight. *)
  then have "MoreHoursOfSunlight e1" by blast
  (* Since Summer has the most sunlight compared to other seasons, we can conclude that there is sunlight during summer. *)
  then have "Sunlight z" 
    using assms explanation_1 by blast
  (* Finally, we can combine all the information to show the hypothesis. *)
  then show ?thesis
