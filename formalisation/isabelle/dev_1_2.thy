(* Explanation 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Consumer x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ TrophicLevel y ∧ At e y)"

(* Explanation 2: Plants are producers are consumers are omnivores. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Plant x ⟶ (Producer x ∧ Consumer x ∧ Omnivore x)"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Omnivore x"
  (* Hypothesis: Omnivores can feed at more than one trophic level. *)
  shows "∀y e. Omnivore x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ TrophicLevel y ∧ At e y)"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that x is an omnivore. *)
  from asm have "Omnivore x" by simp
  (* According to explanation 2, if x is an omnivore, then x is also a consumer. *)
  then have "Consumer x" sledgehammer
  (* From explanation 1, we know that consumers can feed at more than one trophic level. *)
  (* Therefore, we can conclude that omnivores can feed at more than one trophic level. *)
  then show "∀y e. Omnivore x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ TrophicLevel y ∧ At e y)" <ATP>
