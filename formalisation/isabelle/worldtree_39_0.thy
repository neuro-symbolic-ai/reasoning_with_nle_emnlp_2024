(* Explanation 1: summer has the most sunlight. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x y. Summer x ⟶ (Sunlight y ∧ Has x y)"

(* Explanation 2: daylight hours means time during which there is daylight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_2: "∀x y z. DaylightHours x ⟶ (Time y ∧ Means x y ∧ Daylight z ∧ ThereIs z)"

(* Explanation 3: daylight means sunlight. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_3: "∀x y. Daylight x ⟶ Means x y ∧ Sunlight y"

(* Explanation 4: summer is a kind of season. *)
axiomatization where  
  explanation_4: "∀x. Summer x ⟶ Season x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Summer x"
  (* Hypothesis: Summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  shows "∀y z. Season y ∧ When z ∧ MoreHoursOfSunlight z ∧ InNorthernHemisphere z"
proof -
  (* From the premise, we know that summer is true for some entity x. *)
  from asm have "Summer x" by simp
  (* From explanation 4, we can infer that summer is a kind of season. *)
  then have "Season x" by (simp add: explanation_4)
  (* From explanation 1, we know that summer has the most sunlight. *)
  then have "∃y. Sunlight y ∧ Has x y" using assms explanation_1 by auto
  (* We can conclude that there are more hours of sunlight during summer. *)
  then have "MoreHoursOfSunlight z" for z sledgehammer
  (* Finally, we can state that summer is the season when there are more hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. *)
  then show ?thesis <ATP>
