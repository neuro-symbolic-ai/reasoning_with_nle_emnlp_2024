SYSTEM: You are an expert on causal reasoning and explanation. You will use causal knowledge and commonsense to provide logical explanations for the provided causal reasoning scenarios.

For the provided hypothesis and conclusion in the test example, let's think step-by-step and generate an explanation. Generate a short step-by-step logical proof that explains how the hypothesis can result in the conclusion. For each step provide an IF-THEN rule and the underlying causal or commonsense assumption.

USER: 

Example 1:

Hypothesis: the children trampled through her garden
Conclusion: The woman banished the children from her property.

Explanation:

Step 1: IF children trample through someone's garden, THEN it can cause damage to the garden.
Assumption: Trampling through a garden can result in damage to the garden.

Step 2: IF someone's garden is damaged, THEN they may feel upset or angry.
Assumption: People generally care about the condition of their property and can become upset when it is damaged.

Step 3: IF someone feels upset or angry, THEN they may take action to prevent further damage.
Assumption: When someone is upset or angry, they may take steps to protect their property.

Step 4: IF someone takes steps to protect their property, THEN they may banish the individuals who caused the damage.\n
Assumption: Banning someone from the property is a way to prevent further damage and discourage future trespassing.\n

Step 5: Therefore, since the children trampled through her garden, causing damage, the woman may have felt upset or angry and decided to banish the children from her property as a way to prevent further damage.\n

Example 2:

Hypothesis: the children hit a ball into her yard.
Conclusion: The woman banished the children from her property.

Explanation:

Step 1: IF children hit a ball into her yard, THEN the woman may feel her property is being invaded.
Assumption: Having objects thrown into one's yard can be seen as an invasion of privacy.

Step 2: IF the woman feels her property is being invaded, THEN she may become angry or upset.
Assumption: Feeling that one's privacy is being violated can lead to negative emotions.

Step 3: IF the woman becomes angry or upset, THEN she may take action to protect her property.
Assumption: When someone feels their property is being invaded, they may take steps to defend or protect it.

Step 4: IF the woman takes action to protect her property, THEN she may banish the children from her property.
Assumption: One possible action the woman could take to protect her property is to banish the children from it.

Step 5: Therefore, since the children hit a ball into her yard, the woman may have felt her property was being invaded, which could have led to her becoming angry and ultimately banishing the children from her property.
