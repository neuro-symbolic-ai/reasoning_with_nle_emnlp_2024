SYSTEM: You are an expert in semantics, formal language and neo-davidsonian event semantics. 
You will be provided with some sentences. 
These sentences have been transferred into Isabelle/HOL symbolic language. 
However, the quantifiers in the logical form may not be defined correctly.
There might be missing variables after the quantifiers for arguments inside the parentheses of the predicate-argument forms of an axiom or a theorem.
Refine the logical forms if there are any quantifiers that are not defined correctly.
Some instructions:

USER: Here is an example:

Provided Isabelle code:
```
theory qasc_7_1
imports Main

begin

typedecl entity
typedecl event

consts
  Consumer :: "entity ⇒ bool"
  Feed :: "event ⇒ bool"
  Agent :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool"
  At :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool"
  MoreThanOneTrophicLevel :: "entity ⇒ bool"
  Omnivore :: "entity ⇒ bool"

(* Explanation 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∀x e. Consumer x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ At e y ∧ MoreThanOneTrophicLevel y)"

(* Explanation 2: Omnivores are a type of consumer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Omnivore x ⟶ Consumer x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Omnivore x"
  (* Hypothesis: Omnivores can feed at more than one trophic level. *)
  shows "∀x e. Omnivore x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ At e y ∧ MoreThanOneTrophicLevel y)"
  

end
```

Answer:
Explanation 1 states "Many consumers", but it use the universal quantifier '∀'.
We should use the existential quantifier '∃' instead. 
For the quantifier variables in explanation_1, the variable 'y' is missing.
For the quantifier variables in shows, the variable 'y' is missing.

```
theory qasc_7_1
imports Main

begin

typedecl entity
typedecl event

consts
  Consumer :: "entity ⇒ bool"
  Feed :: "event ⇒ bool"
  Agent :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool"
  At :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool"
  MoreThanOneTrophicLevel :: "entity ⇒ bool"
  Omnivore :: "entity ⇒ bool"

(* Explanation 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_1: "∃x y e. Consumer x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ At e y ∧ MoreThanOneTrophicLevel y)"

(* Explanation 2: Omnivores are a type of consumer. *)
axiomatization where
  explanation_2: "∀x. Omnivore x ⟶ Consumer x"

theorem hypothesis:
  assumes asm: "Omnivore x"
  (* Hypothesis: Omnivores can feed at more than one trophic level. *)
  shows "∀x y e. Omnivore x ⟶ (Feed e ∧ Agent e x ∧ At e y ∧ MoreThanOneTrophicLevel y)"

Strictly follow my instructions. 
The quantifier for all Isabelle logical code must be defined correctly according to the natural langauge form (as the comments above each logical form).
You must evaluate and reasoning first then give me the full refined code.


Provided Isabelle code:

Answer:

``` 
answer code goes here (complete refined isabelle code)
```

Strictly follow the instructions that I have claimed.
The answer code should keep the exactly theory/code format as it was provided.
