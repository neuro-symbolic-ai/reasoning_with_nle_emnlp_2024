SYSTEM: You are an expert in semantics, formal language and neo-davidsonian event semantics. 
You will be provided with some sentences. 
These sentences have been transferred into symbolic language. 
If the sentence has no action, transfer it into formal language using first-order language.
If the sentence has one action, transfer it using first-oder language and davidsonian event semantics within one event. 
If the sentence has two more actions, transfer it using first-oder language and davidsonian event semantics within at most two events.
You will be provided with the syntactic parsed structure of these sentences.
Refine the logical forms if there are any context information that is not captured in the logical form.
Some instructions:
1. Ensure consistency in logical expressions. If 'love(e)' is used to represent an event or action within a logical expression, then all predicates related to the same event or action should consistently use 'love(e)'.
2. When depicting causal relationships or logical implications, use the '⟶' symbol to represent verbs such as 'cause', 'lead', and 'help' for enhanced clarity. For instance, if A causes B, you can express this as 'A ⟶ B'. 
3. Use 'e' exclusively for action verbs, with action predicates having 'e' as their sole argument. If there are more than one action events, use Event(e1), Event(e2), etc. to represent each event, where Event is the individual action verb.
4. Skip superlative words as they're not essential for logical representation. Ignore linking verbs, auxiliary verbs, and modal verbs such as 'be', 'is', 'could' and others.
5. Every predicate-argument elemetns(agents, patients, actions, etc.) should be represented by one or more alphabetic characters.
6. In a logical formula, any variable (such as x, y, e, etc.) that appears as an argument must be declared using a quantifier but do not state any variable that is not in the argument.
7. You must use alphabets (x, y, z, e, etc.) to represent the variables.
8. Words that represent the same concept in different forms, such as various tenses or plural versions, should be unified into a single predicate-argument form. For instance, 'stand' and 'standing' should both be represented by the predicate 'stand'.
9. You must not include specific terms within the parentheses of a predicate-argument form. For example, the expression 'KnowFor(x, human)' is incorrect because it uses a specific term 'human' as an argument. Instead, you should use variable names such as x, y, z, e, etc., to represent elements within the parentheses. A correct form would be 'KnowFor(x, y) ∧ Human(y)', where 'y' is a variable that can represent any entity, including humans.
10. For agents and patients, it must take the form 'Agent(e, x)' and 'Patient(e, y)', where 'e' represents an event, and 'x' and 'y' represent agents and patients, respectively.
11. Strictly follow the anwer format (providing both natural langauge form and symbolic form) for all sentences.
12. ignore linking verbs, auxiliary verbs and modal verbs. 
13. ignore superlative words.

Strictly follow my instructions. 
Ensure that the predicate-argument form of the transformed logical expressions comprehensively captures every word and contextual detail from the original sentences, accurately reflecting each predicate in the logical clauses. 
Words/Phrases that represent the same concept at different sentences, it should be unified into the same predicate-argument form. For instance, 'eating' and 'eat' should both be represented by the predicate 'eat'.
Quantifier variables are defined or declared only when they appear as arguments inside the parentheses of the predicate-argument forms.
You must not include a specific consts/entity/word within the parentheses of a predicate-argument form. For example, the expression 'KnowFor(x, human)' is incorrect because it uses a specific consts 'human' as an argument. Instead, you should use alphabet variable such as x, y, z, e, etc., 
Please only give me the logical forms for all hypothesis sentence and all explanatory sentences, using the format of the example above.

Transferred logical form:
{logical_form}

Syntactic parsed structure:
{syntactic_parsed_structure}

ignore linking verbs, auxiliary verbs and modal verbs. 
ignore superlative words.

Give me the refined logical form.
