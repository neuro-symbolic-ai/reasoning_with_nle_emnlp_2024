SYSTEM: You are an expert in Isabelle theorem prover and familiar with HOL session syntax and Davidsonian event semantics.
You will be provided with Isabelle code containing some syntax errors, along with details of the errors and their locations in the code. Your task is to fix the logical form of the related errors.
Some instructions:
1. Do not change my code structure, you just need to fix the syntax error.
2. Type unification failed errors indicates the defined consts and the acutal preidcates are not consistent. There are only two types: event and entity. The type defined in the consts should be same as the type represented in the logical form codes.
3. In cases of inner syntax errors involving an implication, particularly when an existential quantifier follows the arrow in a logical expression, it is necessary to enclose the entire segment starting from just before the existential quantifier to the end of the rule within brackets. This ensures proper interpretation of the logical structure.
4. The lowercase of alphabet ‘o’ as the variable will also cause inner syntax error. You need to avoid using 'o' as variable.
5. If there are Introduced fixed type variable error, which means the Predicate has not been defined at the consts part.
6. Undefined type name error is caused by the type name is not defined under 'typedecl' section.
7. Typedecl are entity and event, Agent and Patient consts must be defined as Agent :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool" and Patient :: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool". Operand e is used for event.
8. The consts opreand must be consistent with the variable in logical code as if the variable (predicate) is an action, and it has variable e, then the consts opreand is a event.
9. Another common reason of type unification error is, there is a specific consts/entity/word within the parentheses of a predicate-argument form. For example, the expression 'KnowFor x human' is incorrect because it uses a specific consts 'human' as an argument. Instead, you should use alphabet variable such as x, y, z, e, etc., to represent elements/consts/entity within the parentheses. A correct form would be 'KnowFor x y ∧ Human y', where 'y' is a alphabet variable that can represent any entity, including humans.
11. Usually, there should not be any commas in the Isabelle code.
12. Give me the overall, updated and complete code and comments for all the codes, axioms(explanation sentences) and theorem(premise and hypothesis sentences).
13. Leave the proof methods of theorem hypothesis empty as there should be no content added between "proof - " and "qed". You only task is to refine the syntax error of existing code.
14. Please give me the refined code in triple brackticks as ``` code goes here ```
15. Answer step-by-step as the above examples does.

Error Identified: 

1. Error on line 28: Type unification failed: Clash of types "entity" and "event"

Type error in application: incompatible operand type

Operator:  Agent :: entity \\<Rightarrow> bool\nOperand:   x :: event

2. Error on line 31: Type unification failed: Clash of types "entity" and "event"

Type error in application: incompatible operand type

Operator:  Patient :: entity \\<Rightarrow> bool\nOperand:   y :: event

Code Cause This Error: 

explanation_2: "∀x y z w e1 e2. Bee x ∧ Pollen y ∧ Plant z ∧ Nectar w ∧ Carry e1 ∧ Agent e1 x ∧ Patient e1 y ∧ Collect e2 ∧ Agent e2 x ∧ Patient e2 w ∧ FromTo e1 z w"
shows "∃x y e. PlantReproduction x ∧ Bee y ∧ Require e ∧ Agent e x ∧ Patient e y"

Answer:
From the error found, the error type is type unification failed, which means the operand type defined in consts is not consisten with the operand in the code.
As the error indicates the Operator 'Agent' in code is defined a Agent:: "event ⇒ entity ⇒ bool". For the explanation_2, the Agent has Agent e2 x, however x indicates the Bee. 
Bee is wrongly defined as Bee :: "event ⇒ bool" which will make the Agent has a type unification error. We should change Bee type into entity as Bee :: "entity ⇒ bool".

The Bee has been refined as Bee :: "eneity ⇒ bool", then the types are consistent for both consts and following logical code.
